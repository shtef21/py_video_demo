# py_video_demo
Demo of Python video editing created with pymovie and Tkinter

## Or is it created with Kivy??

- For this to work, please install opencv-python
- If not installed, moviepy will fall back to PIL, which does not have as many options

- Also install ImageMagick from https://imagemagick.org/
